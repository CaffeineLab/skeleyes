Convert a song into a simple json peak map for our raspberry pi to flicker eyes on plastic skeletons.  It's not going to be a perfect frequency map as the goal is to flicker the eyes by adjusting the brightness without turning them off.  The Raspbery Pi will be controlling a handful of 12v 'Eagle Eye LEDs'.
